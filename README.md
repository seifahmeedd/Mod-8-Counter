# 🔢 Digital Logic Design Project: Modulus-8 Counter

This project implements a **Mod-8 Counter** using J-K Flip-Flops. It cycles through 8 states (0–7) in binary and decimal, demonstrating core principles of sequential logic design.

## 📚 Overview

- **Technology**: J-K Flip-Flops
- **States**: 000 to 111 (binary), 0 to 7 (decimal)
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - State Transition Diagram
  - Timing Diagram (Positive Edge Triggered)
  - Clock Pulse Table
  - JK Flip-Flop Truth Table & Excitation Table
  - Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps)
  - State Table

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Summary

- **Flip-Flops Used**: 3 (since 2³ = 8)
- **Reset Behavior**: After state 7, counter resets to 0
- **Freeze Logic**: Applying logic “0” to the first flip-flop freezes the counter

## 📌 How to Use

If you have simulation software:
1. Open the `.cv` file in your circuit simulator
2. Run clock pulses and observe binary/decimal transitions

Otherwise, explore the report and tables to understand the logic flow.
